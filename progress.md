## Codebase Patterns
- Use `find_or_create_by!` in seeds for idempotent seed data
- Models use `default_scope { order(:position) }` for position-ordered records
- Factory sequences for unique fields: `sequence(:name) { |n| "Plant Type #{n}" }`
- Database constraints (null: false, unique index) should mirror model validations
- Use `dependent: :restrict_with_error` on associations where deletion should be prevented when children exist
- Add `deletable?` method to models that need deletion protection checks
- Turbo Frames use `turbo_frame_tag model_instance` for inline editing patterns
- Request specs go in `spec/requests/` and use `type: :request`
- Flash messages (notice/alert) rendered in application layout
- Non-nested CRUD controllers follow same pattern as PlantTypesController (before_action, set_*, params permit, deletable? guard)
- `default_scope { order(:name) }` for alphabetically-sorted resources (vs `:position` for manually ordered ones)
- `active_purchases_count` method on SeedSource for counting non-used-up purchases

## 2026-02-16 - US-002
- Implemented PlantType model with name (string, unique, not null), description (text), position (integer), timestamps
- Migration includes unique index on name column
- Model has presence/uniqueness validations and default_scope ordering by position
- Seed data: Vegetable, Grain, Herb, Flower, Cover Crop (idempotent via find_or_create_by!)
- Factory uses sequences for unique name generation
- 5 passing specs covering validations, ordering, and factory behavior
- Files changed:
  - db/migrate/20260216233522_create_plant_types.rb
  - app/models/plant_type.rb
  - db/seeds.rb
  - spec/models/plant_type_spec.rb
  - spec/factories/plant_types.rb
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Rails 8.1.2 project with RSpec, FactoryBot, Shoulda Matchers, Faker all pre-configured
  - spec/support/shoulda_matchers.rb already set up
  - FactoryBot syntax methods already included in rails_helper.rb
  - Use `bin/rails generate model` to scaffold model, migration, spec, and factory together

## 2026-02-16 - US-012
- Implemented full CRUD for PlantType, PlantCategory (nested under PlantType), and PlantSubcategory (nested under PlantCategory)
- Changed `dependent: :destroy` to `dependent: :restrict_with_error` on all three models to prevent deletion when children exist
- Added `deletable?` method to all three models for checking deletion safety
- Added `has_many :plants, through: :plant_categories` to PlantType for transitive access
- Created nested routes: `plant_types > plant_categories > plant_subcategories`
- Turbo Frames wrap table rows and edit forms for inline editing without full page reloads
- Breadcrumb navigation on all nested views
- Position field for sort order on all forms
- PlantCategory form includes latin_genus, latin_species, expected_viability_years
- Flash messages (notice/alert) added to application layout
- 141 total specs pass, 0 failures; RuboCop clean
- Files changed:
  - config/routes.rb (added nested routes)
  - app/models/plant_type.rb (restrict_with_error, deletable?, through association)
  - app/models/plant_category.rb (restrict_with_error, deletable?)
  - app/models/plant_subcategory.rb (restrict_with_error, deletable?)
  - app/controllers/plant_types_controller.rb (new)
  - app/controllers/plant_categories_controller.rb (new)
  - app/controllers/plant_subcategories_controller.rb (new)
  - app/views/plant_types/ (index, new, edit, _form)
  - app/views/plant_categories/ (index, new, edit, _form)
  - app/views/plant_subcategories/ (index, new, edit, _form)
  - app/views/layouts/application.html.erb (flash messages)
  - spec/models/plant_type_spec.rb (updated associations, added deletable? tests)
  - spec/models/plant_category_spec.rb (updated associations, added deletable? tests)
  - spec/models/plant_subcategory_spec.rb (updated associations, added deletable? tests)
  - spec/requests/plant_types_spec.rb (new)
  - spec/requests/plant_categories_spec.rb (new)
  - spec/requests/plant_subcategories_spec.rb (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Nested routes create long helper method names like `plant_type_plant_category_plant_subcategories_path`
  - `dependent: :restrict_with_error` adds errors to the model instead of raising an exception, works well with `deletable?` guard
  - Use `turbo_frame_tag model_instance` (passing the model directly) for automatic DOM IDs
  - `button_to` with `method: :delete` needs `form: { data: { turbo_confirm: "..." } }` for confirmation dialogs
  - Rack deprecation: `:unprocessable_entity` is deprecated in favor of `:unprocessable_content` in newer Rack versions

## 2026-02-16 - US-013
- Implemented full CRUD for Seed Sources (list, create, edit, delete)
- Updated SeedSource model: changed `dependent: :destroy` to `dependent: :restrict_with_error`, added `deletable?` method, added `active_purchases_count` method, added `default_scope { order(:name) }` for alphabetical sorting
- Expanded routes from `only: [:index]` to `except: :show` for full CRUD
- Created SeedSourcesController with all CRUD actions following existing pattern
- Created views: index (table with name, website link, active purchases count, notes, actions), _form (name required, URL, notes), new, edit (with turbo_frame_tag)
- Index shows clickable link to supplier website (opens in new tab)
- Delete only available when `deletable?` (no associated purchases), with confirmation dialog
- 160 total specs pass, 0 failures; RuboCop clean
- Files changed:
  - app/models/seed_source.rb (restrict_with_error, deletable?, active_purchases_count, default_scope)
  - app/controllers/seed_sources_controller.rb (full CRUD)
  - app/views/seed_sources/index.html.erb (updated with full table)
  - app/views/seed_sources/_form.html.erb (new)
  - app/views/seed_sources/new.html.erb (new)
  - app/views/seed_sources/edit.html.erb (new)
  - config/routes.rb (expanded seed_sources routes)
  - spec/models/seed_source_spec.rb (updated associations, added deletable?, active_purchases_count, default scope tests)
  - spec/requests/seed_sources_spec.rb (new - full CRUD request specs)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Existing stub controller/views may already exist from US-011 layout work - check before creating from scratch
  - `includes(:seed_purchases)` on index to avoid N+1 queries for active_purchases_count
  - SeedSource uses `order(:name)` default scope unlike taxonomy models which use `order(:position)`
