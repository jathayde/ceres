## Codebase Patterns
- Use `find_or_create_by!` in seeds for idempotent seed data
- Models use `default_scope { order(:position) }` for position-ordered records
- Factory sequences for unique fields: `sequence(:name) { |n| "Plant Type #{n}" }`
- Database constraints (null: false, unique index) should mirror model validations
- Use `dependent: :restrict_with_error` on associations where deletion should be prevented when children exist
- Add `deletable?` method to models that need deletion protection checks
- Turbo Frames use `turbo_frame_tag model_instance` for inline editing patterns
- Request specs go in `spec/requests/` and use `type: :request`
- Flash messages (notice/alert) rendered in application layout
- Non-nested CRUD controllers follow same pattern as PlantTypesController (before_action, set_*, params permit, deletable? guard)
- `default_scope { order(:name) }` for alphabetically-sorted resources (vs `:position` for manually ordered ones)
- `active_purchases_count` method on SeedSource for counting non-used-up purchases
- Cascading dropdowns via Stimulus controller + JSON endpoints (e.g., `categories_for_type`, `subcategories_for_category`)
- Plant form uses `plant_type_id` as a virtual selector (not persisted on Plant), driving category/subcategory cascades
- Use `hidden_field_tag` with empty value for array params (like `planting_seasons[]`) so empty arrays submit correctly
- Inline creation pattern: Stimulus controller + JSON POST endpoint (e.g., `inline_source_controller.js` + `seed_sources/inline_create`)
- Display fields for user-friendly input (dollars, percentage) synced to hidden fields for actual model values (cents, decimal 0-1) via Stimulus
- Bulk actions: use HTML `form` attribute on checkboxes to link them to a hidden `form_with`, with Stimulus controller for select-all/toolbar visibility
- ViewComponents: TaxonomySidebarComponent for hierarchical navigation, InventoryBreadcrumbComponent for breadcrumbs
- Turbo Frame `inventory_content` wraps the main content area; sidebar links use `data-turbo-frame` to target it
- Collapsible tree pattern: `taxonomy_tree_controller.js` Stimulus controller with `expanded` value and `children` target
- Plant model has `active_purchases`, `best_viability_status` methods for inventory display

## 2026-02-16 - US-002
- Implemented PlantType model with name (string, unique, not null), description (text), position (integer), timestamps
- Migration includes unique index on name column
- Model has presence/uniqueness validations and default_scope ordering by position
- Seed data: Vegetable, Grain, Herb, Flower, Cover Crop (idempotent via find_or_create_by!)
- Factory uses sequences for unique name generation
- 5 passing specs covering validations, ordering, and factory behavior
- Files changed:
  - db/migrate/20260216233522_create_plant_types.rb
  - app/models/plant_type.rb
  - db/seeds.rb
  - spec/models/plant_type_spec.rb
  - spec/factories/plant_types.rb
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Rails 8.1.2 project with RSpec, FactoryBot, Shoulda Matchers, Faker all pre-configured
  - spec/support/shoulda_matchers.rb already set up
  - FactoryBot syntax methods already included in rails_helper.rb
  - Use `bin/rails generate model` to scaffold model, migration, spec, and factory together
---

## 2026-02-16 - US-012
- Implemented full CRUD for PlantType, PlantCategory (nested under PlantType), and PlantSubcategory (nested under PlantCategory)
- Changed `dependent: :destroy` to `dependent: :restrict_with_error` on all three models to prevent deletion when children exist
- Added `deletable?` method to all three models for checking deletion safety
- Added `has_many :plants, through: :plant_categories` to PlantType for transitive access
- Created nested routes: `plant_types > plant_categories > plant_subcategories`
- Turbo Frames wrap table rows and edit forms for inline editing without full page reloads
- Breadcrumb navigation on all nested views
- Position field for sort order on all forms
- PlantCategory form includes latin_genus, latin_species, expected_viability_years
- Flash messages (notice/alert) added to application layout
- 141 total specs pass, 0 failures; RuboCop clean
- Files changed:
  - config/routes.rb (added nested routes)
  - app/models/plant_type.rb (restrict_with_error, deletable?, through association)
  - app/models/plant_category.rb (restrict_with_error, deletable?)
  - app/models/plant_subcategory.rb (restrict_with_error, deletable?)
  - app/controllers/plant_types_controller.rb (new)
  - app/controllers/plant_categories_controller.rb (new)
  - app/controllers/plant_subcategories_controller.rb (new)
  - app/views/plant_types/ (index, new, edit, _form)
  - app/views/plant_categories/ (index, new, edit, _form)
  - app/views/plant_subcategories/ (index, new, edit, _form)
  - app/views/layouts/application.html.erb (flash messages)
  - spec/models/plant_type_spec.rb (updated associations, added deletable? tests)
  - spec/models/plant_category_spec.rb (updated associations, added deletable? tests)
  - spec/models/plant_subcategory_spec.rb (updated associations, added deletable? tests)
  - spec/requests/plant_types_spec.rb (new)
  - spec/requests/plant_categories_spec.rb (new)
  - spec/requests/plant_subcategories_spec.rb (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Nested routes create long helper method names like `plant_type_plant_category_plant_subcategories_path`
  - `dependent: :restrict_with_error` adds errors to the model instead of raising an exception, works well with `deletable?` guard
  - Use `turbo_frame_tag model_instance` (passing the model directly) for automatic DOM IDs
  - `button_to` with `method: :delete` needs `form: { data: { turbo_confirm: "..." } }` for confirmation dialogs
  - Rack deprecation: `:unprocessable_entity` is deprecated in favor of `:unprocessable_content` in newer Rack versions

## 2026-02-16 - US-013
- Implemented full CRUD for Seed Sources (list, create, edit, delete)
- Updated SeedSource model: changed `dependent: :destroy` to `dependent: :restrict_with_error`, added `deletable?` method, added `active_purchases_count` method, added `default_scope { order(:name) }` for alphabetical sorting
- Expanded routes from `only: [:index]` to `except: :show` for full CRUD
- Created SeedSourcesController with all CRUD actions following existing pattern
- Created views: index (table with name, website link, active purchases count, notes, actions), _form (name required, URL, notes), new, edit (with turbo_frame_tag)
- Index shows clickable link to supplier website (opens in new tab)
- Delete only available when `deletable?` (no associated purchases), with confirmation dialog
- 160 total specs pass, 0 failures; RuboCop clean
- Files changed:
  - app/models/seed_source.rb (restrict_with_error, deletable?, active_purchases_count, default_scope)
  - app/controllers/seed_sources_controller.rb (full CRUD)
  - app/views/seed_sources/index.html.erb (updated with full table)

  - spec/models/seed_source_spec.rb (updated associations, added deletable?, active_purchases_count, default scope tests)
  - spec/requests/seed_sources_spec.rb (new - full CRUD request specs)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Existing stub controller/views may already exist from US-011 layout work - check before creating from scratch
  - `includes(:seed_purchases)` on index to avoid N+1 queries for active_purchases_count
  - SeedSource uses `order(:name)` default scope unlike taxonomy models which use `order(:position)`

## 2026-02-16 - US-014
- Implemented full CRUD for Plant (Variety) management
- Updated Plant model: changed `dependent: :destroy` to `dependent: :restrict_with_error` for seed_purchases, added `deletable?` method, added `PLANTING_SEASON_OPTIONS` constant
- Created PlantsController with all CRUD actions plus `categories_for_type` and `subcategories_for_category` JSON endpoints for cascading dropdowns

- Created Stimulus `cascading_select_controller.js` for dynamic form updates on type/category change
- Plant type selector drives category dropdown; category selector drives subcategory dropdown
- Subcategory wrapper hidden when category has no subcategories
- Form includes: heirloom checkbox, days to harvest range, winter hardiness, planting seasons multi-select, expected viability years override, notes
- Delete only available when `deletable?` (no associated seed purchases), with confirmation dialog
- 185 total specs pass, 0 failures; RuboCop clean
- Files changed:
  - app/models/plant.rb (restrict_with_error, deletable?, PLANTING_SEASON_OPTIONS)
  - app/controllers/plants_controller.rb (new - full CRUD + JSON endpoints)
  - app/views/plants/index.html.erb (new)
  - app/views/plants/_form.html.erb (new - cascading dropdowns)

  - spec/models/plant_spec.rb (updated dependent association, added deletable? tests)
  - spec/requests/plants_spec.rb (new - full CRUD + JSON endpoint request specs)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Cascading dropdowns use Stimulus controller with JSON endpoints rather than Turbo Frames for simpler implementation
  - Plant type is a virtual selector (not a Plant attribute) used only to drive category filtering
  - `load_form_options` method in controller pre-populates dropdown data for edit forms based on existing associations
  - Array fields like `planting_seasons` need a hidden field with empty value to ensure empty arrays submit correctly
  - Use `references(:plant_category)` with `order("plant_categories.name")` when ordering by an association's column in `includes`
---

## 2026-02-16 - US-015
- Implemented full CRUD for Seed Purchases (list, create, edit, delete) as a standalone resource
- Created SeedPurchasesController with all CRUD actions plus `plants_search` JSON endpoint for plant typeahead
- Created views: index (table with plant, source, year, viability badge, quantity, cost, actions), _form (plant select, seed source select with inline create, purchase details, quantity & cost), new, edit
- Created Stimulus `inline_source_controller.js` for:
  - Inline seed source creation (toggleable form, AJAX POST to `/seed_sources/inline_create`, auto-adds new option to select)
  - Germination rate display (user enters percentage, hidden field stores decimal 0-1)
  - Cost display (user enters dollars, hidden field stores cents)
- Added `inline_create` action to SeedSourcesController returning JSON
- Added routes: `resources :seed_purchases`, `seed_purchases/plants_search`, `seed_sources/inline_create`
- Viability badge displayed on each purchase record using existing ViabilityBadgeComponent
- Used-up purchases shown with dimmed opacity
- 210 total specs pass, 0 failures; RuboCop clean
- Files changed:
  - config/routes.rb (added seed_purchases routes + JSON endpoints)
  - app/controllers/seed_purchases_controller.rb (new - full CRUD + plants_search)
  - app/controllers/seed_sources_controller.rb (added inline_create action)
  - app/views/seed_purchases/index.html.erb (new)
  - app/views/seed_purchases/_form.html.erb (new - with inline source creation)
  - app/views/seed_purchases/new.html.erb (new)
  - app/views/seed_purchases/edit.html.erb (new)
  - app/javascript/controllers/inline_source_controller.js (new - inline source + field conversion)
  - spec/requests/seed_purchases_spec.rb (new - 25 specs covering CRUD + plants_search)
  - spec/requests/seed_sources_spec.rb (added 3 specs for inline_create)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Cost stored as cents (integer) and germination_rate as decimal 0-1 - use display fields for user-friendly input
  - Inline creation pattern: Stimulus controller handles AJAX form, adds new option to existing select element
  - SeedPurchase doesn't need `deletable?` guard - purchases can always be deleted
  - `plants_search` endpoint supports typeahead by searching with ILIKE
  - `plant_id` param on new action enables pre-selecting a plant (for linking from plant detail page)
---

## 2026-02-16 - US-016
- Implemented "Mark as Used Up" / "Mark as Active" toggle on each seed purchase
- Added bulk "Mark as Used Up" action with checkbox selection and Stimulus controller
- Used-up purchases are visually dimmed (opacity-50) and show "Used Up" viability badge
- Added member routes `mark_as_used_up` and `mark_as_active` (PATCH), collection route `bulk_mark_used_up` (PATCH)
- Bulk action uses HTML `form` attribute on checkboxes to associate with a hidden form, avoiding nested form issues
- 221 total specs pass, 0 failures; RuboCop clean
- Files changed:
  - config/routes.rb (added member/collection routes for mark_as_used_up, mark_as_active, bulk_mark_used_up)
  - app/controllers/seed_purchases_controller.rb (added mark_as_used_up, mark_as_active, bulk_mark_used_up actions)
  - app/views/seed_purchases/index.html.erb (added toggle buttons, bulk checkboxes, select-all, bulk toolbar)
  - app/javascript/controllers/bulk_select_controller.js (new - Stimulus controller for checkbox selection + toolbar visibility)
  - spec/requests/seed_purchases_spec.rb (added 11 specs for mark_as_used_up, mark_as_active, bulk_mark_used_up, index display)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use HTML `form` attribute on checkboxes to associate them with a remote form element, avoiding nested `<form>` issues with `button_to`
  - `update_all` returns the count of updated rows, useful for building flash messages
  - Stimulus `indeterminate` property on checkbox for partial selection state
  - Bulk actions need CSRF protection which `form_with` handles automatically
---

## 2026-02-16 - US-017
- Implemented Inventory Browser with hierarchical sidebar navigation
- Created InventoryController with `index` (all plants) and `browse` (filtered by type/category/subcategory) actions
- Created TaxonomySidebarComponent: collapsible tree showing PlantType > PlantCategory > PlantSubcategory hierarchy
- Created InventoryBreadcrumbComponent: breadcrumb trail showing current position in hierarchy
- Created taxonomy_tree_controller.js Stimulus controller for expand/collapse tree nodes
- Plant list shows: variety name, latin name, heirloom badge, best viability status, active purchase count
- Turbo Frames used for content area so sidebar navigation doesn't cause full page reloads
- Added `active_purchases` and `best_viability_status` methods to Plant model
- Updated NavBarComponent to highlight Inventory for browse paths
- Root path now points to inventory#index (replaces home#index)
- 248 total specs pass, 0 failures; RuboCop clean
- Files changed:
  - config/routes.rb (added inventory_browse route, changed root to inventory#index)
  - app/controllers/inventory_controller.rb (new - index + browse actions)
  - app/models/plant.rb (added active_purchases, best_viability_status methods)
  - app/components/taxonomy_sidebar_component.rb (new)
  - app/components/taxonomy_sidebar_component.html.erb (new)
  - app/components/inventory_breadcrumb_component.rb (new)
  - app/components/inventory_breadcrumb_component.html.erb (new)
  - app/components/nav_bar_component.rb (updated active state for browse path)
  - app/views/inventory/index.html.erb (new - main inventory page with sidebar + plant list)
  - app/views/inventory/browse.html.erb (new - filtered view with breadcrumbs)
  - app/views/inventory/_plant_list.html.erb (new - shared plant list partial)
  - app/javascript/controllers/taxonomy_tree_controller.js (new - collapsible tree Stimulus controller)
  - spec/requests/inventory_spec.rb (new - 22 specs covering index, browse by type/category/subcategory, plant list content)
  - spec/models/plant_spec.rb (added 7 specs for active_purchases, best_viability_status)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Turbo Frames with named IDs (e.g., `inventory_content`) let sidebar links target the content area without full page reloads using `data-turbo-frame` attribute
  - `load_browse_context` pattern: check params from most specific (subcategory) to least specific (type) so parent context is always derived
  - ViewComponents are ideal for reusable navigation elements (sidebar, breadcrumbs) - encapsulate rendering logic and selection state
  - `Plant.includes(seed_purchases: :seed_source)` needed to avoid N+1 when computing viability on the plant list
  - Inventory browser uses a standalone route (`inventory/browse`) rather than nested resources to keep URL params simple
