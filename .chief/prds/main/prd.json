  "description": "Ceres is a single-user seed inventory and reference application built with Rails 8 + PostgreSQL. It replaces an 18+ year Excel spreadsheet for managing a personal seed collection of 650+ varieties across vegetables, grains, herbs, flowers, and cover crops. The app tracks what seeds you have, where they came from, whether they're still viable, and how to grow them. It is not a planting journal or garden planner — it's the reference library and inventory system.",
